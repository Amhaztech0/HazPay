## 🎓 How Calls Work

### Audio/Video Call Between 2 People
```
User A taps ☎️ in chat
  ↓
App creates RTCPeerConnection
  ↓
Sends offer to User B via Supabase
  ↓
User B gets notification
  ↓
User B accepts
  ↓
Sends answer back
  ↓
Peer connection established
  ↓
Audio/Video flows directly between them ✅
```

### Audio/Video Call With 3+ People
```
User A taps ☎️ in server
  ↓
App gets JWT token from edge function
  ↓
Joins 100ms room with token
  ↓
100ms sends "user joined" notification
  ↓
User B & C get notified
  ↓
They click join
  ↓
All users in same 100ms room
  ↓
100ms manages video mixing
  ↓
All can see/hear each other ✅
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test on actual devices**, not just emulator
2. **Use WiFi for testing**, cellular may have firewall issues
3. **Grant permissions** when app asks
4. **Check database records** to verify calls were saved
5. **Look at logs** if something fails
